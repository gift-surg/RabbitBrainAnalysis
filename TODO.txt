in vivo study:

* DONE:
Embed initialised transformation of the header from bicommissural to histological coordinates (experiment folder).

Add "openers" for quick visualisation of all the subjects or for all visualisation
of all modalities for the same subjects.

Experiment template propagation on the 0802 in vivo subject to have the preliminary template (experiment folder).

Do the DTI analysis on the in vivo (using embedded initialised transformations - proper coding).

Propagate the preliminary template rigid/non rigid  (proper coding).

Compute statistics in_vivo (proper coding).

Write Hannes the stats.

PROGRESSING:



* TO DO:

Change template first subject. Do not use the 0802 since cerbellar hemispheres are chopped.
Strip the skull based on the preliminary propagation for all modalities in separate folder + correct V1 for FA (proper coding).


- After stats.

Learn sofa and do some tutorials and book reading!

Change template first subject. Do not use the 0802 since cerbellar hemispheres are chopped.
Strip the skull based on the preliminary propagation for all modalities in separate folder + correct V1 for FA (proper coding).

Phrenological assessment from the transformation from the template (new basic folder Z_intracranial assessment).

Code cleaning - remove double code for the stats analysis and the visualiser.
Meaning move forward with label manager and

Conditional random field for the label fusion.
GIT for rabbit.
