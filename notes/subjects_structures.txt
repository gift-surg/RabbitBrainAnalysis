Each subject under A_data/<study>/<cateogory> must have the structure:

/<sj>
--/masks
--/mod
--/segm
--/stereotaxic
-- --/mask
-- --/mod
-- --/segm
-- --/report
--/report

Report can be build in stereotaxic and in the orignal coordinate system (interesting to see the differences for
each subject and run some warning when analysisng the data if differences are too high).

Report will host the Volumes, FA and MD for each region or for macro region subdivisions.
This folder is commited to research and will admit some level of chaos in the early stage.
