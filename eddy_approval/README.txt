Eddy approval
===============

A dummy multi atlas and a dummy target are created using NiLabels.
The dummy target is a ovoidal shape called here Eddy.

The whole pipeline is fed to segment the Eddy with different parameters that should cover most of the cases.
Advantages of using Eddy is in fastest computation and existence of a ground truth.
